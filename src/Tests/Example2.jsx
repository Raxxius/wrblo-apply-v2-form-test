            "WRBLO will require a realistic and well-costed budget to be submitted with the application. Regardless of what you ask us for - you will need to fully cost the project and include every possible expense. WRBLO will not generally pay for items retrospectively, i.e. they will not backdate a grant for items purchased or salaries already paid. You need to wait to hear if you have been successful before any expenditure for the items requested can be made. When applying for funding to cover capital build and equipment, you will need realistic estimates and quotes. For salaries, you are recommended to choose a salary level from a recognized scale. For overheads, it is necessary to detail how you have calculated the costs, for example from previous bills or costs in similar projects. If you are budgeting for a project, which lasts for more than a year, you will have to take inflation and general cost of living increases into account. Staff salary increases, potential increases in electricity, telephone charges and even stationery all have to be budgeted for. Also, if you are applying for a project that is due to start several months away, will the price have increased during those ten months? Consider that WRBLO may accept volunteer hours as a community contribution known as a contribution in-kind as match funding. Match funding is where WRBLO agrees to fund only a percentage of costs and expects funding to be ‘matched' from other sources.",
